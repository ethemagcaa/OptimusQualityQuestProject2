# Amazon Shopping Test Automation 🛒

This project was created to test the **Amazon shopping process** using Selenium and Python.

## 🚀 Why Python?
I was always writing test automation in **Java**, but **this time I wanted to use Python for a difference**. It was a very enjoyable experience thanks to Python's **simple syntax** and **fast development process**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Selenium** 🌍
- **Pytest** ✅

## 📌Testing Process in Summary
1️⃣ Verifies that the Amazon homepage opens.
2️⃣ Searches for the word "Samsung".
3️⃣ Checks the search results.
4️⃣ Moves to page 2 and selects product 3.
5️⃣ Adds product to cart and confirms that it was successfully added.
6️⃣ Deletes product from cart and checks that cart is empty.
7️⃣ Returns to Home Page.

This project provided a great opportunity to **expand my test automation experience** and write tests in a different language. 🚀
